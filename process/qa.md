# Product Quality Control

- Company and the team recognizes the need for a well functioning CI/CD process in the company
- The CI/CD function is well thought out and funded. We use our own products in this environment.
- The CI/CD team will be mainly focused on the e2e testing and deployment infrastructures and automating the processes therein.
- Feature (PRs) will be accepted only after they are added into the CI/CD. Missing to add CI/CD for a feature is considered as a technical sin/crime.
